#### Client:
A distributor Company (Miramax?)
#### Client's question/need:
Academy Awards as criteria for choosing which movies are best to be distributed. What has the biggest influence on total gross earnings? Number of nominations or number or actual awards? Could we affirm that there is a sort of correlation between nominations and earnings? And between actual awards number and earnings?
